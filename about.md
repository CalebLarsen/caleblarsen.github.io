# About Me

Hi! I'm Caleb. I am a lifelong computer nerd, trying to get to the bottom of how these things work.
I have a variety of interests in the field from programming languages, to open-source, to testing, to tooling.
I'm always looking to pick up something new so be warned that my projects are a bit all-over-the-place.
