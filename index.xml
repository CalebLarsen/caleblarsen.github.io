      <description>Nature As a programmer, it is immensely easy for me to avoid all encounters with nature. The most prestigious jobs are located in large cities, the work is done indoors, and field has rather few positions working directly with nature.
This all proves to be rather unfortunate since I find soul dying when I disconnect from nature for too long. Even something as simple as a park can be enough to get me by.</description>

      <description>Hello! Since my inspirations all have a blog, here I am. My goal here is to collect my thoughts, improve as a communicator, and become more of myself. The novelty of this experiment is going to make things a bit rough, but I am of the belief that that is part of the journey. If anyone reads this, I wish you well on your journey and hope that I can be a positive influence, however small.</description>
