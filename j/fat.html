    I am fat. After weighing myself, I found I am 281 pounds. I am 6 foot 1
    meaning that I have a BMI of 37.07, or simply that I am obese. I don't like
    being fat. It <i>weighs</i> on you. Get it. Cuz you're heavy. I started
    getting fat as a teenager. I ate more and more and ran around less and less.
    On my Mormon mission, I walked around a lot and ate far better than I do
    now which kept the weight away. What brought back the pounds was that I was
    still fat at heart. I didn't want to <i>have</i> to exercise. I didn't want
    to <i>have</i> to eat good. Like most things in my life, I wanted to put in
    the minimal effort and get maximum results. So I put in the minimal effort
    and got where I am now. Reading online, I see that I should weigh in the
    144-188 pound range. Making me just about 100 pounds overweight. That's a
    lot. Over a third of me is excess. It's waste. It's a token of my hatred for
    my self and lack of respect for my life. It would be nice if it magically
    went away, but the truth is that I still haven't changed myself. If 100
    pounds melted off of my body overnight, I would just gain it all back.
    Staying at a healthy weight requires making decisions that don't provide
    immediate satisfaction. Thus I feel stuck here.

    How do you get better at delaying gratification. Every time I try it, I just
    find myself becoming more and more resentful at the delays until I snap and
    give up. I don't feel my desire changing. I don't feel myself getting better
    at delaying gratification. It feels like a way to punish myself for having
    chosen wrong until I give up and return to my old ways.

    Maybe I'll make progress someday. I guess I <i>need</i> to make progress
    someday, otherwise I'll die. Wait you die anyways. Why am I trying to change
    then?
