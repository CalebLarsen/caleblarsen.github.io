    <h1 id="nature">Nature</h1>
<p>As a programmer, it is immensely easy for me to avoid all encounters with nature.
The most prestigious jobs are located in large cities, the work is done indoors,
and field has rather few positions working directly with nature.<br>
This all proves to be rather unfortunate since I find soul dying when I disconnect
from nature for too long. Even something as simple as a park can be enough to get me by.
The engineering side of me wonders how to most efficiently squeeze deliberate trips into
the peaceful embrace of the natural, but part of me knows that the calculations themselves
dilute the purpose and meaning of the visits.<br>
A quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson speaks to me on this topic, &ldquo;Adopt the pace of nature; her secret is patience.&rdquo;
I have seen the &ldquo;fast-paced&rdquo; character of modern life criticized over and over again, but having grown in it,
it is hard to see the alternative. Yet, when I leave the trappings of the Internet Era behind, I find myself
free from something I did not know what binding me.<br>
A wise Computer Science professor recommended to me &ldquo;Digital Minimalism&rdquo; by Cal Newport. In it, Newport points out the
variety of ailments that our modern lifestyle causes, including the effect on our mental health. I remember distinctly
having the thought that &ldquo;cellphones are killing my generation.&rdquo; I still hold this belief and wonder if my efforts
to include nature in my life are not a means of staying sane and staying safe.
Regardless, nature is worth it. It is easy to forget it when caught up in our other pastimes, but making time for nature
has made me a more whole human being.</p>
