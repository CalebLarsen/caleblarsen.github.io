      <description>Hello! Since my inspirations all have a blog, here I am. My goal here is to collect my thoughts, improve as a communicator, and become more of myself. The novelty of this experiment is going to make things a bit rough, but I am of the belief that that is part of the journey. If anyone reads this, I wish you well on your journey and hope that I can be a positive influence, however small.</description>
